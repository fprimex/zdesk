The `api_gen` directory and the old `api_gen.py` code has been removed from the
`zdesk` repository. You can now find the API binding generator in its [own
repository](https://github.com/fprimex/zdgen), now called `zdgen`.

The `zdgen` script provided there will be the generator used for future
versions of the `zdesk_api.py` file.
